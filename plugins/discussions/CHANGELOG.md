## 1.1.5

### Patch Changes

- [#22](https://github.com/davincicoding-org/payload-plugins/pull/22) [`def5c00`](https://github.com/davincicoding-org/payload-plugins/commit/def5c0011fa733718249ea4fbfb929d8e221b108) Thanks [@michaelcamper](https://github.com/michaelcamper)! - fix: move @davincicoding/payload-plugin-kit from devDependencies to dependencies

  The plugin-kit package was listed as a devDependency but is imported at runtime.
  This caused "Module not found" errors for consumers after installing from npm,
  since devDependencies are not installed for published packages.

## 1.1.4

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [`d9c65b4`](https://github.com/davincicoding-org/payload-plugins/commit/d9c65b4790095247384d233522945d16418792bc) Thanks [@michaelcamper](https://github.com/michaelcamper)! - Internall changes

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [`bc347db`](https://github.com/davincicoding-org/payload-plugins/commit/bc347db70f32bd24830bdb7cae25d7d477f0d4b5) Thanks [@michaelcamper](https://github.com/michaelcamper)! - Strip declare module 'payload' augmentation from built payload-types.d.ts. Previously, each plugin shipped its own module augmentation with a partial Config, causing CollectionSlug to narrow to only the common subset when multiple plugins were installed together.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`bd14968`](https://github.com/davincicoding-org/payload-plugins/commit/bd14968295ee0170f3c0fedc55673d74d577678b) Thanks [@michaelcamper](https://github.com/michaelcamper)! - The onComment callback is a new public API addition, making this a minor bump. The refactor also changes the component props (documentId/documentCollectionSlug replaced with documentReference), which is technically breaking — but since the field component is a server-rendered internal detail, a minor bump is reasonable.

- [`71a9c33`](https://github.com/davincicoding-org/payload-plugins/commit/71a9c33b64e576a230e7eeca75b364389dcf882f) Thanks [@michaelcamper](https://github.com/michaelcamper)! - Rewrite comment UI with new component architecture (CommentCard, CommentComposer, CommentThread, CommentsPanel, CommentProvider, CommentContext). Add onComment callback with thread context resolution, collapsible reply threads, auto-growing textarea, sticky reply button, relative timestamps, and single-reply enforcement. Simplify endpoints, remove old component implementations, and use string type for collectionSlug.
