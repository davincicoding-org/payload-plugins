When you need documentation for any npm package or library, use the context7 MCP tools (`resolve-library-id` then `query-docs`) instead of WebSearch or WebFetch.

When interacting with GitHub (PRs, issues, repos), use the `gh` CLI via Bash instead of WebFetch or MCP tools.

When providing options to decide from, always include a recommendation
