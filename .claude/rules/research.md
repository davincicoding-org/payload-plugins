When in plan mode or researching a problem:
- Use Context7 to look up documentation for specific libraries/frameworks before implementing
- Use Exa for broader research: recent blog posts, tutorials, comparing approaches, finding examples
- Search before assuming - especially for fast-moving tools

Before writing implementation code, always:
1. Check Context7 for up-to-date docs on the primary libraries involved
2. If Context7 lacks coverage or you need broader context, search with Exa
